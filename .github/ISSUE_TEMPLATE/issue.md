Support Request Guidelines
==================

1. Use Code Samples: Use code snippets whenever possible. This helps us quickly reproduce and understand the issue.

2. Provide A Repro: If the problem is complex, attach a small, self-contained, and debuggable project that highlights the issue with the minimum number of endpoints and dependencies.

3. Simplify Your Code: Avoid copying-pasting code from your actual project. Instead, provide simplified, focused examples that are easy for others to understand.

Note: Requests that don't follow these guidelines may face delays or be closed if deemed low effort.
