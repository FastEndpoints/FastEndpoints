### About The Project

**_FastEndpoints_** is a developer friendly alternative to **ASP.NET Minimal APIs** & **MVC** for rapid **REST API** development. 

The main reason for it's existence is **developer convenience**. It's a very `low cognitive load` way of doing web services and is supposed to discourage developers from over-engineering their solutions. Encourages fat handlers and slim domain models. Makes it a breeze to get rid of **N-Layering** and easily adopt **Vertical Slice Architecture**.

No matter the size or complexity of the project, the framework stays out of their way so that it's easy to focus on the engineering & functional aspects of the systems they're building.

_We don't wanna brag, but there is absolutely no better way in the .NET world right now to build performant REST APIs..._
At least, that's what we're aspiring to...

### How Sponsorship Will Benefit The Project

We are strong proponents of FOSS and would absolutely love FastEndpoints to be self sustainable and have a long and healthy life for the benefit of it's users that are building interesting and innovative things with it who are growing in numbers each day.

Your sponsorship will enable the core contributors to spend more of their valuable time and energy on the project to develop it further while squashing any bugs that may pop up in a timely manner. 

Since no software project is complete without a good support system, we try extremely hard to provide top-notch user support via [github issues](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Library/issues) and our [discord server](https://discord.gg/ARGPxTukpr) which is a full-time job in and of itself.

Your contribution will go a long way to help thousands of users of FastEndpoints in being able to use a high-quality software library made by the community - for the community...

Reaching this goal will enable us to spend more time on the project to develop it further while helping users with their support requests, as well as pay for any external services such as CI/CD, domain renewals and other infrastructure required to keep the project in tip-top shape, as well as any other expenses that pop up related to FastEndpoints.
