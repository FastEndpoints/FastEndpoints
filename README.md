# *ASP.NET Minimal APIs Made Easy...*

## **FastEndpoints** is a developer friendly alternative to Minimal APIs & MVC

It nudges you towards the **[REPR Design Pattern (Request-Endpoint-Response)](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/repr-design-pattern)** for convenient & maintainable endpoint creation with virtually no boilerplate.

Performance is on par with Minimal APIs and does noticeably better than MVC Controllers in synthetic [benchmarks](https://fast-endpoints.com/benchmarks).
