# FastEndpoints

A light-weight REST Api framework for ASP.Net 6 that implements [REPR (Request-Endpoint-Response) Pattern](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/repr-design-pattern).

**FastEndpoints** offers a better alternative than the **Minimal Api** and **MVC Controllers** with the aim of increasing developer productivity. Performance is on par with the Minimal Api and is faster; uses less memory; and outperforms a MVC Controller by about **[46k requests per second](https://fast-endpoints.com/wiki/Benchmarks.html)** in a head-to-head comparison.
