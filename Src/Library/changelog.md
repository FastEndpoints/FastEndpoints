## New 🎉

<details><summary>Support for enforcing antiforgery token checks for non-form requests</summary>

The antiforgery middleware can now be configured to check antiforgery tokens for any content-type by configuring it like so:

```csharp
app.UseAntiforgeryFE(additionalContentTypes: ["application/json"])
```

</details>

## Improvements 🚀

<details><summary>Swagger OneOf support for polymorphic responses</summary>

When enabling `OneOf` for polymorphism like the following:

```csharp
.SwaggerDocument(c => c.UseOneOfForPolymorphism = true)
```

The correct response swagger spec is not generated by NSwag by default. As requested by #807, the correct spec will now be generated.

</details>

<details><summary>Struct support for request DTOs</summary>

Adding the new reflection source generator broke support for struct types to be used for request DTOs, which has been corrected in this release.
