## ‚ùáÔ∏è Help Keep FastEndpoints Free & Open-Source ‚ùáÔ∏è

Due to the current [unfortunate state of FOSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H96Va36xbvo), please consider [becoming a sponsor](https://opencollective.com/fast-endpoints) and help us beat the odds to keep the project alive and free for everyone.

## New üéâ

<details><summary>.NET 9.0 Support</summary>

Migration to .NET 9.0 SDK is now complete. You can now target `net9.0` sdk without any issues.

</details>

<details><summary>Support for enforcing antiforgery token checks for non-form requests</summary>

The antiforgery middleware can now be configured to check antiforgery tokens for any content-type by configuring it like so:

```csharp
app.UseAntiforgeryFE(additionalContentTypes: ["application/json"])
```

</details>

<details><summary>User configurable Endpoint Name (Operation Id) generation</summary>

The endpoint name generation logic can now be overriden at a global level like so:

```csharp
app.UseFastEndpoints(
       c => c.Endpoints.NameGenerator =
                ctx =>
                {
                    return ctx.EndpointType.Name.TrimEnd("Endpoint");
                })
```

</details>

## Improvements üöÄ

<details><summary>Swagger OneOf support for polymorphic responses</summary>

When enabling `OneOf` for polymorphism like the following:

```csharp
.SwaggerDocument(c => c.UseOneOfForPolymorphism = true)
```

The correct response swagger spec is not generated by NSwag by default. As requested by #807, the correct spec will now be generated.

</details>

## Fixes ü™≤

<details><summary>Struct support for request DTOs</summary>

Adding the new reflection source generator broke support for struct types to be used for request DTOs, which has been corrected in this release.

</details>

<details><summary>Struct support for Reflection Source Generator</summary>

The reflection generator was not generating the correct source for unboxing value types.

</details>

<details><summary>Reflection generation for abstract types</summary>

The reflection generator was trying to generate code for deeply nested abstract types, which has now been fixed.

</details>
