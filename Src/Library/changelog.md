## New 🎉

<details><summary>Ability to disable FluentValidation+Swagger integration per rule</summary>

The built-in FV+Swagger integration can be disabled per property rule with the newly added `.SwaggerIgnore()` extension method as shown below.

```csharp
sealed class MyValidator : Validator<MyRequest>
{
    public MyValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(x => x.Id)
            .NotEmpty()
            .SwaggerIgnore();
    }
}
```

## Improvements 🚀

## Fixes 🪲

<details><summary>Global 'TypeInfoResolver' not working</summary>

As reported by #783, there was an oversight in the way the built-in modifiers were checking the existence of custom attributes which lead to DTO properties being marked as "should not serialize".

</details>
