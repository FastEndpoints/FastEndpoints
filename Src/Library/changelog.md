## ‚ùáÔ∏è Help Keep FastEndpoints Free & Open-Source ‚ùáÔ∏è

Due to the current [unfortunate state of FOSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H96Va36xbvo), please consider [becoming a sponsor](https://opencollective.com/fast-endpoints) and help us beat the odds to keep the project alive and free for everyone.

## New üéâ

<details><summary>Specify a request binder per group</summary>

It is now possible to register a particular open generic request binder such as the following:

```csharp
class MyBinder<TRequest> : RequestBinder<TRequest> where TRequest : notnull 
{ 
    public override async ValueTask<TRequest> BindAsync(BinderContext ctx, CancellationToken ct) 
    { 
        var req = await base.BindAsync(ctx, ct); // run the default binding logic
 
        if (req is MyRequest r) 
            r.SomeValue = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(); // do whatever you like
 
        return req; 
    } 
} 
```

only for a certain group configuration, so that only endpoints of that group will have the above custom binder associated with them.

```csharp
sealed class MyGroup : Group 
{ 
    public MyGroup() 
    { 
        Configure("/my-group", ep => ep.RequestBinder(typeof(MyBinder<>))); 
    } 
} 
```

</details>

## Improvements üöÄ

<details><summary>SSE response standard compliance</summary>

The SSE response implementation has been enhanced by making the `Id` property in `StreamItem` optional, adding an optional `Retry` property for client-side reconnection control, as well as introducing an extra `StreamItem` constructor overload for more flexibility. Additionally, the `X-Accel-Buffering: no` response header is now automatically sent to improve compatibility with reverse proxies like NGINX, ensuring streamed data is delivered without buffering. You can now do the following when doing multi-type data responses:

```csharp
yield return new StreamItem("my-event", myData, 3000);
```

</details>

<details><summary>Application host respecting shutdown when using SSE</summary>

The SSE implementation now passes the ApplicationStopping CancellationToken to your IAsyncEnumerable method. This means that streaming is cancelled at least when the application host is shutting down, and also when an user provided CancellationToken (if provided) triggeres it.

```csharp
public override async Task HandleAsync(CancellationToken ct)
{
    await Send.EventStreamAsync(GetMultiDataStream(ct), ct);

    async IAsyncEnumerable<StreamItem> GetMultiDataStream([EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // Here ct is now your user provided CancellationToken combined with the ApplicationStopping CancellationToken.
        while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            await Task.Delay(1000, ct);

            yield return new StreamItem(Guid.NewGuid(), "your-event-type", 42);
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

## Fixes ü™≤

<details><summary>Incorrect enum value for JWT security algorithm was used</summary>

The wrong variant (`SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256Signature`) was being used for creating symmetric JWTs by default.
The default value has been changed to `SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256`. It's recommended to invalidate and regenerate new tokens if you've been using the default.

If for some reason, you'd like to keep using `SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256Signature`, you can set it yourself like so:

```csharp
var token = JwtBearer.CreateToken(
    o =>
    {
        o.SigningKey = ...;
        o.SigningAlgorithm = SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256Signature;
    });
```

</details>


<details><summary>Integration testing extensions ignoring custom header names</summary>

The testing httpclient extensions were ignoring user supplied custom header names such as the following:

```csharp
[FromHeader("x-something")]
```

during the constructing of the http request message. It was instead using the DTO property name completely dismissing the custom header names.
