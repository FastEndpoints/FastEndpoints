## New üéâ

<details><summary>Jwt token revocation middleware</summary>

Jwt token revocation can be easily implemented with the newly provided abstract class like so:

```csharp
public class JwtBlacklistChecker(RequestDelegate next) : JwtRevocationMiddleware(next)
{
    protected override Task<bool> JwtTokenIsValidAsync(string jwtToken, CancellationToken ct)
    { 
        //return true if the supplied token is still valid
    }
}
```

Simply register it before any auth related middleware like so:

```csharp
app.UseJwtRevocation<JwtBlacklistChecker>()
   .UseAuthentication()
   .UseAuthorization()
```

</details>

<details><summary>Ability to override JWT Token creation options per request for Refresh Tokens</summary>

## Improvements üöÄ

<details><summary>Get rid of Swagger middleware ordering requirements</summary>

Swagger middleware ordering is no longer important. You can now place the `.SwaggerDocument()` and `.UseSwaggerGen()` calls wherever you prefer.

</details>

## Fixes ü™≤

<details><summary>Swagger generator issue with [FromBody] properties</summary>

The referenced schema was generated as a `OneOf` instead of a direct `$ref` when a request DTO property was being annotated with the `[FromBody]` attribute.

</details>

<details><summary>Kiota client generation issue with 'clean output' setting</summary>

If the setting for cleaning the output folder was enabled, Kiota client generation was throwing an error that it can't find the input swagger json file, because Kiota deletes everything in the output folder when that setting is enabled. From now on, if the setting is enabled, the swagger json file will be created in the system temp folder instead of the output folder.
