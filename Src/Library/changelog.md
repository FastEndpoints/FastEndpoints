## Minor Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

<details><summary>Pre/Post Processor interface changes</summary>

todo: describe the change and how to migrate

</details>

<details><summary>AddJWTBearerAuth() default claim type mapping behavior change</summary>

The `JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap` static dictionary is presently used by ASP.NET for mapping claim types for inbound claim type mapping. In most
cases people use `JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear()` to not have long claim types such
as `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier` as the claim type for the `sub` claim for example.

The default behavior has now been changed to make the claim types not use the SOAP type identifies like above. If for some reason you'd like to revert to the old
behavior, it can be achieved like so:

```csharp
.AddJWTBearerAuth("jwt_signing_key", o =>
{
    o.MapInboundClaims = true;
});
```

See #526 for more info.
