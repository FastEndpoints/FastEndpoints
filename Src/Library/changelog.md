## ‚ùáÔ∏è Help Keep FastEndpoints Free & Open-Source ‚ùáÔ∏è

Due to the current [unfortunate state of FOSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H96Va36xbvo), please consider [becoming a sponsor](https://opencollective.com/fast-endpoints) and help us beat the odds to keep the project alive and free for everyone.

## New üéâ

## Improvements üöÄ

<details><summary>Ability to customize param names for strongly typed route params</summary>

It is now possible to customize the route param names when using the [strongly typed route params](https://fast-endpoints.com/docs/misc-conveniences#strongly-typed-route-parameters) feature by simply decorating the target dto property with a `[BindFrom("customName"))]` attribute. If a `BindFrom` attribute annotation is not present on the property, the actual name of the property itself will end up being the route param name.

## Fixes ü™≤

<details><summary>Header example value not picked up from swagger example request</summary>

If a request DTO specifies a custom header name that is different from the property name such as the following:

```cs
sealed class GetItemRequest
{
    [FromHeader("x-correlation-id")]
    public Guid CorrelationId { get; init; }
}
```

and a summary example request is provided such as the following:

```cs
Summary(s => s.ExampleRequest = new GetItemRequest()
{
    CorrelationId = "54321"
});
```

the example value from the summary example property was not being picked up due to an oversight.

</details>

<details><summary>Xml comments not picked up by swagger for request schema</summary>

There was a regression in the code path that was picking up `Summary` xml comments from DTO properties in certain scenarios, which has now been fixed.

</details>

<details><summary>Incorrect swagger example generation when '[FromBody] or [FromForm]' was used</summary>

If a request DTO was defined like this:

```cs
sealed class MyRequest
{
    [FromBody]
    public Something Body { get; set; }
}
```

and an example request is provided via the Summary like this:

```cs
Summary(x=>x.ExampleRequest = new MyRequest()
{
    Body = new Something()
    {
        ...
    }
});
```

swagger generated the incorrect request example value which included the property name, which it shouldn't have.
