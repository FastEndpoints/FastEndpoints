## New üéâ

## Improvements üöÄ

<details><summary>Relax DTO type constraint on 'Validator&lt;TRequest&gt;' class</summary>

The type constraint on the `Validator<TRequest>` class has been relaxed to `notnull` so that struct type DTOs can be validated.

</details>

<details><summary>Allow TestFixture's TearDownAsync method to make Http calls</summary>

Previously the `TestFixture<TProgram>` class would dispose the default http client before executing the teardown method. This prevents cleanup code to be able to make http calls. Now the http client is only disposed after `TearDownAsync` has completed.

</details>

<details><summary>Ability to strip symbols from Swagger group/tag names</summary>

Given a route like:

```
/api/admin-dashboard/ticket/{id}
```

And swagger config like this:

```csharp
bld.Services.SwaggerDocument(
    o =>
    {
        o.AutoTagPathSegmentIndex = 2;
        o.TagCase = TagCase.TitleCase;
        o.TagStripSymbols = true; //this option is new
    });
```

The resulting group/tag name will be:

```
AdminDashboard
```

</details>

<details><summary>Ability to customize job queue storage provider re-check frequency</summary>

You can now customize the job queue storage provider re-check time delay in case you need re-scheduled jobs to execute quicker.

```csharp
app.UseJobQueues( 
    o => 
    { 
        o.StorageProbeDelay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5); 
    });
```

</details>

## Fixes ü™≤

<details><summary>Swagger UI displaying random text for email fields</summary>

When a FluentValidator rule is attached to a property that's an email address, Swagger UI was displaying a random string of characters instead of showing an email address. This has been rectified.

</details>

<details><summary>Swagger generation issue with form content and empty request DTO</summary>

Endpoints configured like below, where the request dto type is `EmptyRequest` and the endpoint allows form content; was causing the swagger processor to throw an error, which has been rectified.

```csharp
sealed class MyEndpoint : EndpointWithoutRequest<MyResponse>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        ...
        AllowFileUploads(); 
    }
}
```

</details>

<details><summary>Swagger issue with reference type DTO props being marked as nullable</summary>

Given a DTO such as this:

```csharp
sealed class MyRequest
{
    public string PropOne { get; set; }
    public string? PropTwo { get; set; }
}
```

The following swagger spec was generated before:

```json
"parameters": [
    {
        "name": "propOne",
        "in": "query",
        "required": true,
        "schema": {
            "type": "string",
            "nullable": true //this is wrong as property is not marked nullable
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "propTwo",
        "in": "query",
        "schema": {
            "type": "string",
            "nullable": true
        }
    }
]
```

Non-nullable reference types are not correctly generated as non-nullable.
