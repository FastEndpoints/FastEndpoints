## Improvements 🚀

<details><summary>Make Pre/Post Processor Context's 'Request' property nullable</summary>

Since there are certain edge cases where the `Request` property can be `null` such as when STJ receives invalid JSON input from the client and fails to successfully deserialize the content. Even in those cases, pre/post processors would be executed where the pre/post processor context's `Request` property would be null. This change would allow the compiler to remind you to check for null if the `Request` property is accessed from pre/post processors.

## Fixes 🪲

<details><summary>Nullable 'IFormFile' handling issue with 'HttpClient' extensions</summary>

The `HttpClient` extensions for integration testing was not correctly handling nullable `IFormFile` properties in request DTOs when automatically converting them to form fields, which has now been remedied.
