## ‚ùáÔ∏è Help Keep FastEndpoints Free & Open-Source ‚ùáÔ∏è

Due to the current [unfortunate state of FOSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H96Va36xbvo), please consider [becoming a sponsor](https://opencollective.com/fast-endpoints) and help us beat the odds to keep the project alive and free for everyone.

## New üéâ

<details><summary>Specify max request body size per endpoint</summary>

Instead of globally increasing the max request body size in Kestrel, you can now set a max body size per endpoint where necessary like so:

```csharp
public override void Configure()
{
    Post("/file-upload");
    AllowFileUploads();
    MaxRequestBodySize(50 * 1024 * 1024);
}
```

</details>

<details><summary>Customize error response builder func when using 'ProblemDetails'</summary>

You can now specify a custom response builder function when doing `.UseProblemDetails()` as shown below in case you have a special requirement to use a certain shape
for one or more of your endpoints while the rest of the endpoints use the standard response.

```csharp
app.UseFastEndpoints(
       c => c.Errors.UseProblemDetails(
           p =>
           {
               p.ResponseBuilder = (failures, ctx, statusCode) =>
                                   {
                                       if (ctx.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/group-name"))
                                       {
                                           // return any shape you want to be serialized
                                           return new
                                           {
                                               Errors = failures
                                           };
                                       }

                                       // anything else will use the standard problem details.
                                       return new ProblemDetails(failures, ctx.Request.Path, ctx.TraceIdentifier, statusCode);
                                   };
           }))
```

</details>

<details><summary>Specify a request binder per group</summary>

It is now possible to register a particular open generic request binder such as the following:

```csharp
class MyBinder<TRequest> : RequestBinder<TRequest> where TRequest : notnull 
{ 
    public override async ValueTask<TRequest> BindAsync(BinderContext ctx, CancellationToken ct) 
    { 
        var req = await base.BindAsync(ctx, ct); // run the default binding logic
 
        if (req is MyRequest r) 
            r.SomeValue = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(); // do whatever you like
 
        return req; 
    } 
} 
```

only for a certain group configuration, so that only endpoints of that group will have the above custom binder associated with them.

```csharp
sealed class MyGroup : Group 
{ 
    public MyGroup() 
    { 
        Configure("/my-group", ep => ep.RequestBinder(typeof(MyBinder<>))); 
    } 
} 
```

</details>

## Improvements üöÄ

<details><summary>Recursive validation of  Data Annotation Attributes</summary>

Until now, only the top level properties of a request DTO was being validated when using Data Annotation Attributes. This release adds support for recursively validating the whole object graph and generating errors for each that fails validation.

</details>

<details><summary>SSE response standard compliance</summary>

The SSE response implementation has been enhanced by making the `Id` property in `StreamItem` optional, adding an optional `Retry` property for client-side reconnection control, as well as introducing an extra `StreamItem` constructor overload for more flexibility. Additionally, the `X-Accel-Buffering: no` response header is now automatically sent to improve compatibility with reverse proxies like NGINX, ensuring streamed data is delivered without buffering. You can now do the following when doing multi-type data responses:

```csharp
yield return new StreamItem("my-event", myData, 3000);
```

</details>

<details><summary>Respect app shutdown when using SSE</summary>

The SSE implementation now passes the `ApplicationStopping` cancellation token to your `IAsyncEnumerable` method. This means that streaming is cancelled at least when the application host is shutting down, and also when a user provided `CancellationToken` (if provided) triggers it.

```csharp
public override async Task HandleAsync(CancellationToken ct)
{
    await Send.EventStreamAsync(GetMultiDataStream(ct), ct);

    async IAsyncEnumerable<StreamItem> GetMultiDataStream([EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // Here ct is now your user provided CancellationToken combined with the ApplicationStopping CancellationToken.
        while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            await Task.Delay(1000, ct);

            yield return new StreamItem(Guid.NewGuid(), "your-event-type", 42);
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

## Fixes ü™≤

<details><summary>Incorrect enum value for JWT security algorithm was used</summary>

The wrong variant (`SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256Signature`) was being used for creating symmetric JWTs by default.
The default value has been changed to `SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256`. It's recommended to invalidate and regenerate new tokens if you've been using the default.

If for some reason, you'd like to keep using `SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256Signature`, you can set it yourself like so:

```csharp
var token = JwtBearer.CreateToken(
    o =>
    {
        o.SigningKey = ...;
        o.SigningAlgorithm = SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256Signature;
    });
```

</details>


<details><summary>Integration testing extensions ignoring custom header names</summary>

The testing httpclient extensions were ignoring user supplied custom header names such as the following:

```csharp
[FromHeader("x-something")]
```

during the constructing of the http request message. It was instead using the DTO property name completely dismissing the custom header names.

</details>

<details><summary>Integration test extensions causing 404 if grouped endpoint configured with empty string</summary>

The test helper methods were constructing the url/route of the endpoint being tested incorrectly if that endpoint belonged to a group and was configured with an empty route like so:

```csharp
sealed class MyGroup : Group 
{ 
    public MyGroup() 
    { 
        Configure("my-group", ep => ep.AllowAnonymous()); 
    } 
} 
 
sealed class Request 
{ 
    [QueryParam] 
    public string Id { get; set; } 
} 
 
sealed class RootEndpoint : Endpoint<Request, string> 
{ 
    public override void Configure() 
    { 
        Get(string.Empty); 
        Group<MyGroup>(); 
    } 
 
    ...
}
```

</details>

<details><summary>Swagger generation failing when DTO inherits a virtual base property</summary>

When a base class has a virtual property that a derived class was overriding as shown below, Swagger generator was throwing an exception due an internal dictionary key duplication.

```csharp
public abstract class BaseDto
{
    public virtual string Name { get; set; }
}

sealed class DerivedClass : BaseDto
{
    public override string Name { get; set; }
}
```

</details>
